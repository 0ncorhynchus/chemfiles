C++ API
=======


The full public C++ API is contained in the ``Chemharp.hpp`` header, which should
be included in all the programs using Chemharp. All the classes are in the
``harp`` namespace, so you may want to use ``using namespace harp;`` at the
begining of your program in order to bring all the class in the main namespace.


No macro are defined, and all the classes are described in the :ref:`classes-reference`
section, which is the main reference for the C++ API.
