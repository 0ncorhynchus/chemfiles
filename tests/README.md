# Test for the Chemharp library

The majority of theses tests needs some data file which you will need to get. If
you got the code with git, please use:

```bash
git submodules init
git submodule update
```

If you download the code as an archive from a release, please download the
corresponding archive from [the test repository](https://github.com/Luthaf/Chemharp-Tests/releases), and unpack the
archive into the `data` folder.
